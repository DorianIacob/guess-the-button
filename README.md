Guess the winning button (3 buttons)

Guess the button is the first project/game in my life :) that I created myself using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
How do you play it:
- you have 3 buttons, and only one of them is the winning one
- press one of the buttons
- if you have pressed the winning one there appears the "You guessed! :)" message on the screen
- if you don't, then there appears the "You didn't guessed! :)" message on the screen
Enjoy playing! :)
